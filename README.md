# CUDA

I like high-performance computing applications. Unfortunately, I don't own a GPU, let alone a NVIDIA one. I've taken to using LeetGPU, which offers a CUDA playground for people to create simple CUDA kernels. GPU Computing looks really interesting, now that I'm taking a Computer Architecture course in college. It also helps that I do know C/C++. I'm recording my progress with the help of puzzles which instruct me to write kernels (even the naive version, sometimes) so that I can learn things along the way.
