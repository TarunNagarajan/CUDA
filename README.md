# CUDA

This repository documents my CUDA learning journey focused on AI inference and systems-level GPU programming.
Although I donâ€™t have access to a GPU locally, I use LeetGPU.com to write and test CUDA kernels.
I'm following the book *Programming Massively Parallel Processors* by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu, along with the Official CUDA documentation.
