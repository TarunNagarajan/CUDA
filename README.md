# CUDA

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) serves as the bridge between high‑level code and the raw parallel power of NVIDIA GPUs, enabling developers to offload compute‑intensive workloads—such as matrix multiplies, convolutional kernels, and particle simulations—directly onto specialized hardware. By exposing a C‑style API (and wrappers for higher‑level languages like C++ and Python), CUDA allows programmers to define thousands of lightweight “threads” that execute the same instructions in lockstep, maximizing throughput across the GPU’s hundreds or thousands of cores. Its memory hierarchy (global, shared, and registers) and synchronization primitives give fine‑grained control over data locality and inter‑thread coordination, which is crucial for squeezing out peak performance in deep learning, scientific computing, and real‑time graphics pipelines. With libraries like cuBLAS, cuDNN, and thrust, CUDA abstracts much of the complexity while still offering hooks for handwritten kernels; this combination of ease‑of‑use and low‑level access makes CUDA the de facto standard for harnessing GPU hardware acceleration in modern compute applications.
